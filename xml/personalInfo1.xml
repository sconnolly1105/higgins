He worked as a driver for Guinness. He would sometimes visit Lettercallow in his car (it is unclear if this was the car he drove for Guinness or his own personal vehicle). Mary Higgins Connolly from Oughterard remembered that he was alway on alert to ensure that the local children didn't go near the car, a fact that didn't amuse her even in her late seventies.

He had a daughter Mary (born 1908) when he was approximately 19 years old. She was included in her grandfather's (Sean, Bartley's father) household in the 1911 census but Bartley himself was not in that household.
It seem that he left his family in Lettercallow and went to England where he married again (bigamously?) and had at least one more child
